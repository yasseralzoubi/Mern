        <h1>My Boring Website</h1>  
    
        <p id="paragraph">  
            This website is boring, with very little CSS.   
            However, we really just care about the JavaScript.   
            For example, if you click   
            <button id="button">this button</button>, the background of this paragraph tag will change to blue.  
        </p>  
    
        <p>  
            We also have a <button id="alert">alert</button> button that will grab the text from the input below and show it in a popup.  
        </p>  
    
        <div>  
            <input type="text" id="popup-input">  
        </div>  
    
        <p>  
            We just like random interactivity on the site, including a fun effect if you hover over   
            <span id="hover-this"><b>this.</b></span>  
        </p>  
        
        <p onclick="changeBackground(this)">  
            Another task: This should be another feature.  
            I want to click anywhere in this paragraph tag and I want to be able to change the background color to whatever is in this input:   
            <input type="text" id="color-input"/>.  
        </p>
